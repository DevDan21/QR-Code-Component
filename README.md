## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was relatively easy based on what I already know about HTML & CSS.
Styling this was pretty straight forward when it came to the fonts, font-sizes and the image. As well as keeping this responsive for desktop and mobile.

My process was to complete the layout before centering the design. Once it came to that did I hit my first speed bump.
Centering elements on a page seems to be a simple process however I've always had difficutly figuring it out. From using different methods like flexbox, grid and the famous absolute position.
I decided to use flexbox for this solution however in future projects I think I would try absolute positioning again to get a bit of a refresher and to challenge myself more.

Once I was done I had a look at my code again to clean it up and make it more efficient.
Overall this was a fun and quick project to build and I am looking forward to the next one.

What is your best case in centering elements on a page? I would love to know how and why you use a particular process to do so.

Happy coding everyone!
